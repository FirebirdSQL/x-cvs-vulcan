/* Compatibility matrix for latch types.

   An exclusive latch is needed to modify a page.  Before
   marking a page an 'io-prevention' latch is needed: a mark latch.
   To look at a buffer, a shared latch is needed.  To write a page,
   an io latch is needed.  

   Exclusive and shared latches interact.  Io and mark latches 
   interact.

   An mark latch is implemented as an io latch.
   
   Latches are granted in the order in which they are
   queued with one notable exception -- if buffer write
   is in-progress then shared latches are granted ahead
   of any pending exclusive latches.
