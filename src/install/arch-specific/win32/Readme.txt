o Are you sure you understand how Firebird works?

  Perhaps you are seeing the correct behaviour and you
  really have a support question. In this case contact
  the fb-support list server.
 
  You may subscribe here: 

    mailto:fb-support-subscribe@yahoogroups.com


o Still think it is a bug? 

  Check the list of Open Bugs. This can be found at:
  
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=9028&atid=109028

Otherwise, if you are reasonably sure it is a bug then
please try to develop a reproducible test case. You 
can then submit it to the Firebird bug tracker via:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=9028&atid=109028
  
You do not need to be a member of the Firebird 
project to log a bug, but you do need to have set up a
Sourceforge account.
