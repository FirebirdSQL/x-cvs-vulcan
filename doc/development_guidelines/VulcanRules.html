be declared as instances of the string class JString.
<li value=4>No character string declared as &#147;const char*&#148;

it to a incorrectly declared function for method.
</ol></ol><ol type=1><li value=4>Numeric data
<ol type=1><li value=1>Byte array data will be declared as

<ol type=1><li value=1>Developers may use whatever coding conventions 
they prefer in their working areas, but checked in code must
